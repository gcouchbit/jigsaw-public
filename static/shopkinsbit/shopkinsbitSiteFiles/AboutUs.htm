          <h3>Introduction</h3>
              <hr>
          <p>Jigsaw Enterprises L.L.C. is land forming company with an engineering reach, focusing on sustainable development projects, operating in both prime and sub-contractor roles as project alignment dictates. Our diversified equipment fleet is staffed by a fully trained and experienced workforce guided by a management team with almost 200 years 
          combined experience.  Having successfully completed a wide variety of projects in a broad spectrum of fields in both mining and civil disciplines, we are prepared to meet the challenges of any earth moving or site development project.</p>
          <br></br>
           
          <h3>History</h3>
            <hr>
          <p>Our roots are in the surface mining of coal.  The company from which Jigsaw evolved began surface mining in 1975 and we are still mining today.  Our projects in the mining industry range from mine development, maintenance and reclamation and extend to surface coal production. We have a long record of operating safe, efficient and 
          environmentally friendly coal mines. In fact, we take great pride in our culture of safety and our highest priority is to create a safe environment for our employees and our community. These efforts were recognized by the Mine Safety and Health Administration in 2010 when we were awarded two Sentinels of Safety Awards for our safety achievements. 
          Environmental stewardship is also emphasized in all aspects of our operations and we continually strive to protect and improve the environment. Our stewardship in mining has been recognized by DMRE award for outstanding reclamation of a surface coal mine.</p><br></br> 

          <h3>Civil</h3>
            <hr>
          <p>In fields related to civil engineering, we have completed the earthwork portions of such diverse projects as sports complexes, residential subdivisions, commercial building sites, recreational sites, oil/gas well locations, and numerous municipal, county, and state transportation projects.  Completed projects include golf courses, athletic fields, state and city parks, and historic preservation sites. These projects involved grade and drain, sub drains, storm drains, underground utilities, geogrids, engineered fills, retaining walls, soil nails, reinforced concrete, site clearing, demolition, drilling, mass excavation, and hydro seeding.</p>
